This is a small personal blog that I made for all things GIS related. On this site you will find tuturials, workflows, some personal projects (to show off my GIS skills) and much more!

### About me

My name is Reinhardt and I am a GIS Specialist with over 8 years' experience in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry. My experience has been gained in various Water, Treatment, Urban Infrastructure, Electrical, Environmental, Transport, Stormwater, Digital, Project Management, and Multidisciplinary engineering projects. During this time, I have been responsible for managing, maintaining, and creating various GIS and digital products and services. These range from high-quality map production to mobile GIS data collection solutions and web map applications. I am also passionate about the Digital Transformation of the industry, with a focus on integrating GIS and Building Information Modeling (BIM).
